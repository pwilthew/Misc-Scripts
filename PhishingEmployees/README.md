# Phishing Employees

Employees are the weakest cybersecurity link, and phishing is the number one medium for ransomware and other malware.

This project aims to train employees to detect and report when they receive a phishing email. 

The `phishing.py` script is used to send a fake phising email to employees in order to track who needs more Security Awareness Training! :) 

The script `get-phished-employees.py` opens and parses the web logs to get the names of the employees who open the link in the fake phishing email.
